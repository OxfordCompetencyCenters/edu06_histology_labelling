abstract: >
  An Azure ML pipeline for automated histology slides' analyses combining 
  cell segmentation (Cellpose), clustering (ResNet -> UMAP -> DBSCAN), and 
  experimental classification (multimodal-LLM). Includes various other features
  such as magnification level, tile filtering for improved processing efficiency,
  slide-level parallelization.
